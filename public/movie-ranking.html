    <h3>Hell's Paradise</h3>
    <p>This show has awesome battles, dynamic characters, and really invokes a lot of emotions in my heart. Also, I like
        how its not too childish as it sometimes has mature romance which people are fighting for their lives. The world
        building is so good and makes me want to live in the world as well. I love the power system and how the
        protagonists are slowly discovering it to defeat the bad buys.</p>

    <h3>Blue Lock</h4>
        <p>Its not that deep but god damn it got me into soccer. Great animations, story lines, and characteres!</p>

        <h3>Haikyuu</h3>
        <p>Just a banger. Nothing better than young kids giving it all to chase their dreams.</p>
